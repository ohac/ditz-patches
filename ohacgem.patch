+icalendar
+---------
+
+This plugin adds ability to export full todo list in iCalendar (RFC 2445) format.
+It is useful for integration with different pim software like KOrganizer.
+
+Issues are converted to VTODO entries with completion status set to 50 if
+its state is :in_progress, 100 if it's closed and 0 otherwise.
+Progress for release is 100 if it's released otherwise it's 99 * closed/all
+issues. So maximum for active release is 99 and it's not shown as done until
+released.
+
+Commands added:
+  ditz todo-ics: generate full todo list in iCalendar format

+Usage:
+  1. add a line "- icalendar" to the .ditz-plugins file in the project root

+sha-names
+---------
+
+This world's-smallest-ditz-plugin uses the initial 5 characters of
+the SHA id instead of an identifier like "ditz-999".  Installing
+this plugin will cause all references of the form 'ditz-123' and
+'engine-57' to change to '1a2bc', 'f33d0' and similarly memorable
+IDs.  If you are comfortable working with them (your clients may
+not be...)  these make all issue IDs unique across the project, so
+long as you do not get a collision between two 5-hex-char IDs.
+
+Without this plugin, the standard ID for an issue will be of the
+form 'design-123'. Whilst this is easier to remember, it is also
+liable to change - for example, if two ditz trees are merged
+together, or if an issue is re-assigned from one component to
+another. This plugin provides a canonical, immutable ID from the
+time of issue creation.
+
+Usage:
+  1. add a line "- sha-names" to the .ditz-plugins file in the
+  project root
